## 0.3.4

- Removed unused dependency 'requests'

## 0.3.3

- Fixes: On some thermostats (e.g Heatit) you are currently not able to readout current
  measured temperature (room temp sensor or floor temp sensor) directly on the thermostat card as it is on a different device.

Note that the temperature sensor that have the "Set as main temp sensor" checkbox checked in the Futurehome app will be used.

## 0.3.2

- Added basic HAN sensor support
- Updated README
  - Clearer installation instructions
  - Added 'Known issues' section

## 0.3.1

- Fixes: Fails to install on Home Assistant. Error: `The command '/bin/ash -o pipefail -c apk add --no-cache python3 py-pip && pip3 install --upgrade pip' returned a non-zero code: 1`
- (dev) moved devcontainer.json file to the recommended folder. Ref [docs](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/add-ons/testing/)

## 0.3.0

### New, fixed, and improved:

- Huge code rewrite to be more adaptive
- Added basic lock/unlock for doorlocks. Tested with IDLock 150 (Unlock commands are currently not supported on Zigbee)
- Added thermostat support
  - Set mode
  - Set target temp
  - Change fan speed if device supports it (e.g Sensibo)
- Added humidity sensor
- Fixed `meter_elec` service for accumulated energy usage (kWh)
- Expanded `meter_elec` service for devices that supports this:
  - Power (W)
  - Voltage (V)
  - Current (A)
- Changed mode sensor to be a (dropdown) select, so you are able to switch mode
- Added shortcuts support
- Added room support
  - Devices will be placed in rooms with the same names as Futurehome. If the room does not exist it will be created
- All devices now generate MQTT devices and group all common sensors and controls
- (dev) added .env file to be sourced with `python-dotenv`

### Planned and work in progress:

- HAN sensor support
- On some thermostats (e.g Heatit) you are currently not able to readout current
  measured temperature (room temp sensor or floor temp sensor) directly on the thermostat card as it is on a different device
- Fails to install on Home Assistant. Error: `The command '/bin/ash -o pipefail -c apk add --no-cache python3 py-pip && pip3 install --upgrade pip' returned a non-zero code: 1`

### Known issues:

- Some devices might still use sensor_power (deprecated) and sensor_voltage (deprecated) instead of `meter_elec`

## 0.2.2

- Added mode sensor as `sensor.fh_mode` (home, away, sleep, vacation). Read only

## 0.2.1

- Added presence sensors

## 0.2

- Huge code rewrite. Code base has been reduced
- Most things from 0.1 should work
  - Dimmers for lightning
  - Binary switches for appliances and lightning
  - Sensors: battery, illuminance, temperature, electric meters
- Modus switch is not re-implemented yet
- Internal bridge for Dimmer lights have been removed, reducing complexity in addon
- Entities are now generated based on device id Futurehome and not the name using `object_id`
- Simplified configuration. No need for long-lived token and uptime sensor as HA announces restarts via MQTT
- Rewritten MQTT discovery
- Added Energy sensor for all devices which supports this (Â´meter_elec`)
